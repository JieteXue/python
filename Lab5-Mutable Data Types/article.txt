As stocks maintained their smooth and steady climb in recent years few trades were as alluring or as profitable as a bet that volatility as measured by Wall Streets socalled fear gauge had vanished

Hedge fund titans in their Manhattan offices and day traders in their living rooms have poured billions of dollars into opaque debtfueled funds known as exchangetraded notes racier versions of the exchangetraded funds that track every variety of index or investment and can be bought and sold just like a stock

Now stocks are swinging wildly and volatility is soaring  and investors who piled into these funds confident that the calm would continue are getting rattled On Tuesday Credit Suisse the sponsor of the most popular fund for making such bets said it was closing down the fund

Credit Suisse closed the fund  informally called XIV which moves in the opposite direction of the fear gauge known as VIX  after it experienced a fall of greater than  percent a price drop that left XIV trading at a deep discount relative to the value of its assets

It had been an extraordinary ride for XIV formally known as the Velocity Shares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN It was one of a number of funds tied to VIX known officially as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index some of which move in the same direction tracking the index up or down

VIX which measures investor expectations that stocks will rise or fall sharply in the future has been at extreme lows in recent years making XIV very attractive to investors and pushing it to  billion in size Just last Wednesday it took in a record  million as investors stuck even more firmly to their belief that volatility was not a concern

In the two years from January  to the middle of last month XIVs value shot up more than  percent reaching a recent peak of 

After VIX surged on Monday XIV dropped like a rock falling from  to  in afterhours trading

In just two days investors in XIV and a similar fund ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures SVXY saw their assets shrink dramatically from a combined total of  billion to about  million

People are scared out of their minds  they are in really rough shape said Seth Golden who left his job as a manager at a Target store to take up shorting VIX as a fulltime business from his living room in Ocala Fla

Profiled in The New York Times last summer Mr Golden exemplifies perhaps in a cautionary way how easy it has become to gamble on whether volatility in the stock market will be high or low

He has been able to do so because investment banks have created more than  highrisk highreturn securities that allow any investor to bet against VIX Some of the products require large amounts of leverage debt that can amplify gains and losses

Mr Goldens preferred vehicles are the iPath SP  VIX Short Term Futures and ProShares Ultra VIX ShortTerm Futures which he has been betting against for years in trades that have been lucrative  until now

After VIX shot up  percent the largest move in its history to  on Monday Mr Golden acknowledged that he was feeling some pain On Tuesday the index spiked again reaching  before falling back to just below 

It is really stressful he said I was up until the wee hours checking my phone to see where VIX futures were trading

Nonetheless he said on Tuesday that he was still wagering  percent of his portfolio or  that volatility would fall as it had in the past

That Mr Golden and others like him are getting hurt on these risky niche trades should not in theory have a wider effect on the market While investments in these funds have been substantial recently their combined value is just  billion a blip in a market worth trillions of dollars

But volatility specialists have warned for years that the popularity of the investments has skewed the broader VIX index keeping it artificially low in good times and pushing it higher than it should go in times of stress

That was the case on Monday bankers and traders said when XIV collapsed as VIX soared in lateafternoon trading That was because as XIV and SVXY plummeted traders were forced to scoop up hundreds of millions of dollars in VIX futures to cover the short positions they had on the index That drove it higher and prompted computerized trading systems to sell stocks and bonds by the truckload

These products definitely had an impact on the VIX said Pravit Chintawongvanich the head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors And that exacerbated the decline in stocks It was a vicious circle
